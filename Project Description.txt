Project Description : 

Theme: Electric Vehicle
Technology: Generative AI

Dataset: Electric Vehicle Analytics Dataset.
Electric Vehicle dataset with performance, charging, cost, and battery metrics.

Problem statement: Using the provided EV dataset, develop AI-driven models to predict key outcomes (e.g. battery state-of-health, charging cost, resale value) and to optimize performance and cost-efficiency.

Proposed Solution:

Predictive Dashboard (Best for Internship)

ðŸŽ¯ Final Output: An interactive web dashboard (using Streamlit or Dash)
where the user enters EV details (like model, mileage, charge cycles, avg temperature)
and gets:

ðŸ”‹ Predicted Battery Health (%)

âš¡ Estimated Monthly Charging Cost (â‚¹/$)

ðŸ“Š Feature importance (what affects cost the most)

In particular, one might focus on predicting battery degradation (SOH) and charging costs to enable proactive maintenance and cost savings
. For example, accurately forecasting EV battery health helps schedule maintenance before failures and extends battery life
. Likewise, modeling how electricity price and usage affect monthly charging cost can guide smart charging strategies. Other problem facets include estimating total cost of ownership (maintenance + insurance + charging) or predicting resale value from features like battery health and mileage.

Model Selection: Machine Learning 

Learning Model: 1.Supervised learning(Supervised learning uses input features (X) to predict a known output (y)).
                2.Regression: Linear Regression (data has linear relationships (battery health decreases steadily with charge cycles, temperature, etc.),

â†’ Linear Regression is simple, interpretable, and perfect for internship-level demonstration.)
