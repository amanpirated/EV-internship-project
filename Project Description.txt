Project Description : 

Theme: Electric Vehicle
Technology: Generative AI

Dataset: Electric Vehicle Analytics Dataset.
Electric Vehicle dataset with performance, charging, cost, and battery metrics.

Problem statement: Using the provided EV dataset, develop AI-driven models to predict key outcomes (e.g. battery state-of-health, charging cost, resale value) and to optimize performance and cost-efficiency

Model Selection: Machine Learning 

Learning Model: 1.Supervised learning(Supervised learning uses input features (X) to predict a known output (y)).
                2.Regression: Linear Regression (data has linear relationships (battery health decreases steadily with charge cycles, temperature, etc.),
â†’ Linear Regression is simple, interpretable, and perfect for internship-level demonstration.)
